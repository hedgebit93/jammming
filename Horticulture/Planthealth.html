        <h2>Maintaining Plant Health</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>1. Understand the importance of using safe, healthy and environmentally sustainable practices for the maintenance of plant health.</h3>
                <div>
                    <h4>1.1. Explain what is meant by physical, cultural , chemical or biological control.</h4>
                    <div>
                    <h4>Methods of Control</h4>
                    <p><strong>Physical Control</strong></p>
                    <p>Physical control refers to the mechanical or hand controls where the pest is actually 
                        attacked and destroyed and is particularly effective as a control method for weeds.
                    </p>
                        <p>Personal safety: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Hoes have sharp edges and may pose a risk for injury unless handled appropriately. </li>
                                <li>It is important to know what weeds are being handled - for example, the sap of <em>Heracleum mantegazzianum</em> is phytotoxic, meaning that it may cause blisters to form on the skin of sensitive people in the presence of sunlight.</li>
                                <li>Some materials suitable for use as mulches may also pose a risk for dermetitis in sensative people. Often the best approach is to ensure suitable gloves are worn.</li>
                                <li>If choosing black polythene for use as a mulch, consider only biodegradable mulches so that the material breaks down and does not pose as an environmentally-damagin product after it is no longer effective as a mulch.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <p><strong>Physical Barrier</strong></p>
                        <p>Horticultural Fleece can be put in place to prevent damage on carrot and cabbage of roof fly. Caterpillars of many species including the cabbage white butterfly and the cabbage moth are prevented from laying eggs.</p>
                        <p><strong>Benefits and Limitations</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <p>Benefits:</p>
                            <li>Is unlikely to cause harm to the environment.</li>
                            <li>Can be very targeted and effective for small infestations.</li>

                            <p>Limitations:</p>
                            <li>Not effective for large areas of infestation.</li>
                            <li>Relies on regular monitoring and physical intervention.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Cultural Control</h4>
                        <p>Cultural control is understanding and manipulating the environment where the plant is growing to help reduce threats to plant health.
                            Cultural control for pests and disease is a preventative course of action. Pests and diseases outbreaks can be reduced in their effects by good husbandry techniques.
                            The soils should be prepared appropriately and be fertile and well drained. Plants which require a particular pH should have their needs met.</p>
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Garden Hygiene</strong></p>
                        <p>Often overlooked, but essentially good cultural techniques and garden hygiene with plant debris and crop residues are most significant in reducing the scale of any problems which may occur. <br><br>
                            Weeds should not only be removed, but rubbish heaps should be burnt or composted properly. Affected branches and leaves of trees and plants should also be removed, and fruits containing larvae pciked up where possible.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <p>Benefits:</p>
                            <li>Environmentally acceptable.</li>
                            <li>Can be very specific.</li>
                            <p>Limitations:</p>
                            <li>May be labour intensive.</li>
                            <li>May be ineffective where large infestations occur or where a large area of crop is found.</li>
                        </ul>
